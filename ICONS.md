# Icon Files Required

The Chrome extension requires the following icon files:

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software or online tools:

1. **Design a simple icon** representing tab groups or organization
2. **Export in PNG format** at the required sizes
3. **Place the files** in the extension root directory

## Icon Suggestions

- Use a folder or group icon design
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use consistent colors and style
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Alternative

If you don't have icon files ready, you can:
1. Use any existing PNG files and rename them
2. Create simple placeholder icons
3. Remove the icons section from manifest.json temporarily

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
